<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><img class="main-image" src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/12/atlas.jpg" alt="Das Lichtenheim"><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>## How are the connections between humans worth in reality?An astonishing fact is, although AI tech has been widely promoted today, most people can’t tell out the exact value it’s produced, only compromising they (working-bots) are taking away their job occupations. It seems they have worried about the destruction effect on old economic system too much to start to reconstruct a brand-new system.Instead, people in some low-individual-productivity areas such as China and India, often got a consensus of AI is just made for the replacement of low-end labour forces. For example, An AI-doctor is just made for replacing the low-salaried community (rural) doctors rather than so-called national rewarded experts. They believe that there must be some indescribable “humanity” that only human-doctor can acquire.Well, my theory to explain this phenomenon is we actually don’t need to creat AI to replace those workers in those territories, the modern capitalism system will automatically wipe out the least effective ways of value-production. If we hold a conception that AI industry is just a replacement of old industry, than itself might get an even-lower productivity expectation than those low-ends.The truth is, the practitioners of traditional industry still have a misunderstanding about the value of the labour forces of themselves. Nowadays, traditional workers tend to sell their social connections instead of sell simple labour forces. This is because of the great devaluation of human labour forces brought by technical revolutions. But in some areas, social network, or equally speaking, human-hierarchy structure’s evolving process is deliberately fell behind manufacturing industry. So this made connection-selling more realizable and more profitable. Such as 三和大神.Several couples of days before, I heard about a speech to emphasize that we acquired ultimate “happiness” from the irreplaceable humanity services. Well, when I was young, unfortunately, I was born in a relationship-distorted family, and never had felt the “textbook-like” parents’ love but I discovered multiple interests after starting my independent life, I can acquire happiness without paying for the “luxury” human-services. Such as to buy an astronomical-priced house for a marriage. So that’s why those people are largely over-estimated the value of social connections and similarly under-estimated the value of AI. AI’s capability is not replacement, it’s reconstruction.Two hundreds years ago, when horseless-carriage(car) firstly showed up in Qing dynasty, a lot of upper-class mandarins thought that this dump and tough stuff could only be apply to transporting some soldiers or slaves, royal governors would always choose human-sedan-chair for transporting. They might have various reasons, such as human’s shoulder is softer than steels, human sedan-chair drivers have indescribable “experiences” to let governors felt comfortable on the chairs. Human drivers are more obedience or something.But the first Chinese owners of cars are obviously the highest class of this society. I don’t want to see the same story might appear on AI.(End)(Background Image From: FM84@youtube)</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><hr><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><strong>201805 English Freetalk</strong></p>

Intuitively, this noun was created by imitating the word “gene” in the biological territory. This implies that memes could be inherited and interfered just like the gene fragments on the DNA molecules.But remember not to put collective consciousness equivalent to it. Memes are so identical that when you’re talking about them, you’ve clearly recognized they’re some memes. Sometimes, they look like to be created and casted deliberately by some prophets.So, as studying on genes could help us to understand human-bodies, studying on memes is certainly helpful to explore the unknown aspects of human-minds. Respectively, culture itself and meme are playing two opponent roles of social level mind-interaction. Culture tends to isolate different societies, while meme keeps the ground consistency of them. This statement is a little bit similar to the babel story recorded in the Bibel. Speaking of ancient legends, recently I’ve read about the prehistory mythology of Japan called “古事記、日本書紀”. Society like Yayoi Japan is a typical hybrid but isolated community. You can discover a large amount of typical memes in the creation myths of Yayoi Japan. For instances, the “banana” legend and “Don’t-look-back” legend.The “banana” legend is also known as “Adam’s apple” legend, so it’ve been widely spread from east to west as long as the society has a basic explanation of the creation of lifeforms. Technically, it reflected the consistent anxious originated from the awakening of self-consciousness. Meanwhile, “Don’t-look-back” legend also occupied a massive proportion of creation myths, it could be interpreted as a caveat of betraying the elementary contraction of the community.Well, this passage is not merely written for this topic, we’re gonna go further about the background of those memes. As we’ve discussed, memes are measuring the over-all similarity of cultural environments. It is somehow like authenticators of blockchain. Perhaps we can take it as a metaphor of similarity metrics of cultures. Here we might naturally recall the basic metrics of similarity — the cosine similarity. The most effective context when this metrics works is to process some embedded corpus-type data or some coordinate location informations. That means it has a strong dependence to data’s geometric specification — the orthogonality. If we expand the freedom degree of testing data, to some deconvoluted images or time-sequences, we also have got some experienced widely-applied functions to calculate the signal similarity. As for Images, we have the structural similarity, which is more favorable to photographer’s to measure photo’s distortion. As for languages, we have BLEU score which have been successfully integrated into today’s neural-translation.But what if data has a far-more complicated structure than all above? we had to abandon all traditional static metrics and start to build a reinforced network to interpret the similarity of this hierarchy. Ironically, supervised learning here might give little help due to itself always need some metrics to create gradients for back propagation.Finally, we turned way back to cultures and memes, if we tried to build a truly “brainish” stuff to interpret behaviors of a whole society, what should we do when facing this potential of complexity? Keep designing a brand-new static metrics for supervised learning, or straightly perform an astronomical-hyperparametered unsupervised learning, or try to reconstruct an institute to integrated them organically together?This might be interesting if we gonna spend some attentions on.(Background Angel's Egg)</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><hr><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><strong>201803 English Freetalk</strong></p>

Actually, based on this misunderstanding, history researchers even with the same ideology may argued endlessly for the precise partitioning of human history.So how to calm this debate? To start up, we should go for a more elementary question: Why we need to partition the history? Is history itself a indivisible integrity? The answer is obviously yes. But attempting to partition the boundless history to some characterized periods is an effective method to help us learning about the details of historical developing trends.The reason that Carl Marx decided to study about historical partitioning was generated by his questing about the origin of Class. This opinion has been written in his famous literal work “Das Kapital”. He assumes the evolution of productivity generated different ruling class and working class. But the actual situations were varied among western and eastern societies.A well-known historical TBS video game series called “Civilization” demonstrated a new type of historical partitioning according to the depth of Tech-tree. This means your country must invent the right technology at the right time, until your collected all the supposed technologies you can upgrade to the next era. Considering the accumulation of human’s knowledge system, the speed of time-flowing acts exponentially to simulate the reality.At this circumstance, our history was divided as Stone age (Pre-agriculture), Bronze age (Primary agriculture), Iron age (Mature agriculture), Steam age (Primary Industry), Computer age (Mature Industry) and the Future age.But this method still is not the perfect. The invention of any technology in reality is stochastic, not seems to be like well-planned. And upgrading the total technology level is not the main topic for a long time in some type of societies. Running a country is not some how like playing a video-game.What is the indispensable characteristic of human history? Marx’ve gave us the answer of “Arbeit”, anthropologists would say “Language”, some dictators would say “Power”. Recently explosive growing AI-related research’ve unveiled that “Arbeit” is not the most principal character of human being. Then we can focus on “Language”, a fluent language application ability is still the untouchable diamond on the top of AI-research’s crown. Furthermore, the data that proves particular sentiments (especially social moods) were increasingly being observed.But tracing this slight character is too hard even with deep network. All of them were submerged into the massive noises of culture diversities. Some superstructures such as religions have captured the attraction of several researchers such as Yuval Harari, author of “A Brief History of Humankind”. In this literal work, history of humankind was divided through the religions’ impact on the reconstruction of humankind cognition. “Cognitive Revolution” (Invention of world-wide religions), “Agriculture Revolution”, “Unification of Humankind” (Geographic Discovery), “Science Revolution” are the four main eras definited in the book. This depicted a magnificent scenerio of the volunteered integration of the entire humankind. As a tiny creature, I hardly can test this theory in my lifetime. But in my experiences, the entire humankind society at a scale of history, is gradually falling apart rather than volunteered unifying. As it was explained in natural evolution of species, every step of evolution is aimless. So I seldom be interested in this kind of magnificent narration. I once believed in a creed, when you study something, you should jump out of its own sight. The truth of history might be located in the details of each living creatures. Speaking of individuals, I have a robust method of checking the degree of civilization of a specific human-community. That is how much a individual’s capability can be quantified as social resources. Perhaps if we define society as a machine serving for every member, this metrics is the ultimate meaning that the effectiveness of it can be figured out with. To go deeper through this theory, we can easily find that “Religion Community” has the lowest conversion rate, which is a main social formation type of early human history, following with “Family Community”, after the technology explosion we faced a brand new era of “Corporation Community” (Western world) or “Official Community” (Eastern world) which means people can only obtain social resources decently by selling their freedom to a corporation or an official system. In the future, on my blueprint, every individual would be independent to any social economic system, every social members can hold their own small-sized economic systems, and meanwhile acquire the maximum freedom to develop themselves at every dimensions.(End)Background Image from @http://aaas.org</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><hr>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shuang Song's Resume]]></title><description><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h1 id="shuangsong">SHUANG SONG</h1>
